Hi y'all!

My name is Walker Blackston. I am a PhD student in epidemiology with a background in the humanities. I've worked in restaurants, labs, coffee shops, the government and academia, but am really just a curious kid from Mississippi.

It's my hope that you find some value or connection with this blog- as I wish I had when I was making the wild and unclear transition from the arts to the sciences. I still have lots to learn, so we are in this together!

P.S. Expect pictures of my 110 pound retreiver, Opal, to be heavily featured.
